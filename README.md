## 📌 Overview

**MIP-Editor** is a novel method for **cross-modal unlearning** in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It identifies and edits influential neuron paths across vision and language modalities to selectively remove unwanted knowledge (e.g., memorized private data, harmful associations) without retraining the entire model.
